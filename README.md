# SearchBar React Component

## Overview

The `SearchBar` component is a versatile and interactive search input for React applications. It provides a search input field that can be customized with auto-suggest functionality, allowing users to search for items with ease.

## Features

- **Dynamic Search**: Users can type in the search input to find relevant items.
- **Auto-Suggest**: As users type, the component can suggest search options.
- **Customizable**: The component can be styled and configured to suit your application's needs.

## Installation

1. Download both `SearchBar.js` and its associated `SearchBar.css` files.
2. Place them into your project's appropriate directory.

## Usage

```jsx
import SearchBar from './path/to/SearchBar';

function App() {
  const handleSearch = (query) => {
    // Implement your search logic here with the query.
    console.log(`Searching for: ${query}`);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <SearchBar onSearch={handleSearch} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Props

- `onSearch` (Function): A callback function that is called when the user initiates a search. It receives the user's query as a parameter.

## Styling

The following CSS classes can be used to style the `SearchBar` component:

- `.custom-search-bar`: Styles the main container of the search bar.
- `.custom-search-bar input[type="text"]`: Styles the text input field.
- `.custom-search-bar .suggestions`: Styles the dropdown menu for auto-suggestions.
- `.custom-search-bar .suggestions li`: Styles each suggestion item in the dropdown menu.

Customize these classes to achieve the desired look and feel for your search bar.
